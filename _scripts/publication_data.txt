    chips, inspired by structural and dynamical properties of the biological brain,
    show a high energy efficiency in running artificial neural-network architectures
    for the profit of generative applications. This encourages employing such hardware
    systems as platforms for simulations of quantum systems. Here we report on the

    as variational ansatz functions for quantum many-body states. However, high-dimensional
    sampling spaces and transient autocorrelations confront these approaches with
    a challenging computational bottleneck. Compared to conventional neural networks,
    physical model devices offer a fast, efficient and inherently parallel substrate
    capable of related forms of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we demonstrate
    the ability of a neuromorphic chip to represent the ground states of quantum spin
    models by variational energy minimization. We develop a training algorithm and
    apply it to the transverse field Ising model, showing good performance at moderate
    system sizes (N{$\leq$}10). A systematic hyperparameter study shows that performance
    depends on sample quality, which is limited by temporal parameter variations on
    the analog neuromorphic chip. Our work thus provides an important step towards

    Many computational approaches have been developed for tackling the sign problem

  abstract: 'Understanding how closed quantum systems dynamically approach thermal
    equilibrium presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics. Generically,
    it is expected that non-integrable quantum systems thermalize as they comply with
    the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). A notable exception to this is
    the phenomenon of many-body localization, where the emergence of local conserved
    quantities prevents thermalization, which has been observed in finite low-dimensional
    systems. We study an ensemble of Heisenberg spins with a tunable distribution
    of random coupling strengths realized by a Rydberg quantum simulator. The total
    magnetization as a function of external field after a quench serves as a probe
    for thermalization. We find that such an isolated quantum system exhibits a non-thermalizing
    regime despite being non-integrable. It is shown that thermalization can be restored
    by reducing the disorder in the coupling strengths. As our system consists of
    up to 4000 spins, we thus show that closed quantum systems can fail to reach thermal
    equilibrium even at system sizes approaching the thermodynamic limit.'

  abstract: 'Strongly interacting quantum systems subject to quenched disorder exhibit
    intriguing phenomena such as glassiness and many-body localization. Theoretical
    studies have mainly focused on disorder in the from of random potentials, while
    many experimental realizations naturally feature disorder in the interparticle
    interactions. Inspired by cold Rydberg gases, where such disorder can be engineered
    using the dipole blockade effect, we study a Heisenberg XXZ spin model where the
    disorder is exclusively due to random spin-spin couplings, arising from power-law
    interactions between randomly positioned spins. Using established spectral and
    eigenstate properties and entanglement entropy, we show that this system exhibits
    a localization crossover and identify strongly interacting pairs as emergent local
    conserved quantities in the system, leading to an intuitive physical picture consistent
    with our numerical results. '

  abstract: 'A major goal toward understanding far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum
    many-body systems consists in finding indications of universality in the sense
    that the dynamics no longer depends on microscopic details of the system. We realize
    a large range of many-body spin systems on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator by
    choosing appropriate Rydberg state combinations. We use this platform to compare
    the magnetization relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg XX-, XXZ- and Ising
    Hamiltonians in a scalable fashion. After appropriate rescaling of evolution time,
    the dynamics collapse onto a single curve. We find that the observed universal
    behavior is captured by theoretical models that only consider local pairs of spins.
    Associated to each pair is a local quasi-conserved quantity, allowing us to describe
    the early time dynamics of the system in terms of an integrable model similar
    to systems featuring prethermalization. Since the dynamics of pairs are independent
    of the type of Hamiltonian up to a scaling factor, this integrable model explains
    the observed universal relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg quantum spin
    systems. '

  abstract: 'Neural quantum states are a new family of variational ansätze for quantum-many
    body wave functions with advantageous properties in the notoriously challenging
    case of two spatial dimensions. Since their introduction a wide variety of different
    network architectures has been employed to study paradigmatic models in quantum
    many-body physics with a particular focus on quantum spin models. Nonetheless,
    many questions remain about the effect that the choice of architecture has on
    the performance on a given task. In this work, we present a unified comparison
    of a selection of popular network architectures and symmetrization schemes employed
    for ground state searches of prototypical spin Hamiltonians, namely the two-dimensional
    transverse-field Ising model and the J1-J2 model. In the presence of a non-trivial
    sign structure of the ground states, we find that the details of symmetrization
    crucially influence the performance. We describe this effect in detail and discuss
    its consequences, especially for autoregressive models, as their direct sampling
    procedure is not compatible with the symmetrization procedure that we found to
    be optimal. '

  abstract: 'We train a neuromorphic hardware chip to approximate the ground states
    of quantum spin models by variational energy minimization. Compared to variational
    artificial neural networks using Markov chain Monte Carlo for sample generation,
    this approach has the advantage that the neuromorphic device generates samples
    in a fast and inherently parallel fashion. We develop a training algorithm and
    apply it to the transverse field Ising model, showing good performance at moderate
    system sizes (N≤10). A systematic hyperparameter study shows that scalability
    to larger system sizes mainly depends on sample quality which is limited by parameter
    drifts on the analog neuromorphic chip. The learning performance shows a threshold
    behavior as a function of the number of variational parameters of the ansatz,
    with approximately 50 hidden neurons being sufficient for representing critical
    ground states up to N=10. The 6+1-bit resolution of the network parameters does
    not limit the reachable approximation quality in the current setup. Our work provides
    an important step towards harnessing the capabilities of neuromorphic hardware
    for tackling the curse of dimensionality in quantum many-body problems. '

  abstract: 'Modern day quantum simulators can prepare a wide variety of quantum states
    but extracting observables from the resulting "quantum data" often poses a challenge.
    We tackle this problem by developing a quantum state tomography scheme which relies
    on approximating the probability distribution over the outcomes of an informationally
    complete measurement in a variational manifold represented by a convolutional
    neural network. We show an excellent representability of prototypical ground-
    and steady states with this ansatz using a number of variational parameters that
    scales polynomially in system size. This compressed representation allows us to
    reconstruct states with high classical fidelities outperforming standard methods
    such as maximum likelihood estimation. Furthermore, it achieves a reduction of
    the root mean square errors of observables by up to an order of magnitude compared
    to their direct estimation from experimental data. '

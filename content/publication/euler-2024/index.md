abstract: 'We investigate a disorder-free quantum Ising chain subject to a time-periodic
  drive that rotates each spin by an angle $\pi⁢(1−\epsilon_i)$. In case all spins
  experience the same deviation $\epsilon$ and the system is initialized in a fully
  polarized state, the dynamics is known to be time crystalline: the magnetization
  of the system exhibits period-doubled oscillations for timescales that grow exponentially
  with the length of the chain. In this work, we study the effect of a deviation $\epsilon$
  that differs between spins. We find that reducing $\epsilon$ for a single spin drastically
  enhances the lifetime of spatiotemporal order, suggesting the name metronome spin.
  Employing perturbative arguments in an average Hamiltonian picture, we explain this
  observation for initial states with macroscopic bulk magnetization. Furthermore,
  in the case of random bit-string initial states, we report the enhancement of the
  lifetime of a topological edge mode, which can also be understood in the same picture.
  Finally, we discuss an altered geometry in which the metronome spin is not directly
  part of the chain, affecting the dynamics in different ways in the two scenarios
  considered. Our findings unveil the intricate dynamics that emerge in Floquet systems
  under the influence of a spatially varying drive, thereby uncovering new avenues
  for Floquet engineering.'

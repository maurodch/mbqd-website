abstract: 'An important step towards a comprehensive understanding of far-from-equilibrium
  dynamics of quantum many-body systems is the identification of unifying features
  that are independent of microscopic details of the system. We experimentally observe
  such robust features in the magnetization relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg
  XX, XXZ, and Ising Hamiltonians. We realize these Heisenberg spin models with tunable
  anisotropy parameter and power-law interactions in an ensemble of Rydberg atoms
  by encoding the spin in suitable Rydberg state combinations. We consistently observe
  stretched-exponential relaxation of magnetization for all considered spin models,
  collapsing onto a single curve after appropriate rescaling of time. This robust
  short-time relaxation behavior is explained by a perturbative treatment that exploits
  the strong disorder in pairwise couplings, which leads to a description in terms
  of approximately independent pairs of spins. In numerical simulations of small systems,
  we show that these pairs of spins constitute approximate local integrals of motion,
  which remain at least partially conserved on a timescale exceeding the duration
  of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization.                                                                               Published

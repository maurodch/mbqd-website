This lecture introduces basic physical and mathematical concepts which quantum technologies are based on. Video material will be complemented by homework exercises, including programming exercises, Q&A sessions and tutorials. This lecture is open to external partcipants within the EFEQT master program. It will be given in collaboration with Shannon Whitlock from the University of Strasbourg. It consists of 8 topical blocks.

Topics include:
- Linear algebra basics: Vector spaces, operators, spectral decomposition
- Python programming basics
- Quantum mechanics of discrete systems
- Quantum computing: The circuit model and basic quantum algorithms
- Physical systems for quantum technologies
- Quantum errors: Noise and decoherence
- Density matrix formalism
- Quantum simulation
- Quantum sensing
- Entanglement
- Quantum communication

Dates and time: Mondays 14:15-16:00h, INF 227 / SR 1.403/4, first session on 17.10.2022, Tutorials: Wednesday 16:15-18:, INF 227 / SR 3.402

Heidelberg students should sign up for the lecture in the exercise group system at: https://uebungen.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/v/1498

Course materials will be provided on a separate platform.

Course requirements: Basic knowledge of quantum mechanics (Theoretical Physics IV).

Mode of examination: The grade will be based on a written exam.

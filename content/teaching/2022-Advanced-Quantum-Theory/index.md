This lecture gives an introduction to quantum information theory and theory of open quantum systems. The lecture is accompanied by exercises and bi-weekly tutorials.

Topics include:
- Recap of basic quantum mechanics: Postulates, qubit systems, density matrix
- Quantum measurement
- Quantum entanglement
- Schmidt decomposition and purifications
- EPR paradox and Bell inequalities
- Quantum channels
- Distance measures between quantum states
- Classical and quantum entropy
- Quantum thermalization
- Lindblad Master equation

If you want to participate in this lecture, please sign up for the [tutorials](https://uebungen.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/vorlesung/20221/1484).

#### Dates and rooms
Lecture Mondays 14:15-16:00 starting on 25.04.2022. Room: Philos.-weg 12 / kHS. 

Tutorials biweekly on Tuesdays 14:15-16:00 or Wednesdays 14:15-16:00.

#### Prerequisites
Solid knowledge of quantum mechanics (PEP3+PTP4). Theoretical Quantum Statistics or Introduction to Quantum Science and Technology is very useful.

#### Mode of examination
The grade will be based on a written exam.

#### Literature
- [Quantum computation and quantum information](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf) by Nielsen and Chuang\
Classic textbook. We will focus in the quantum information part.
- [The Theory of Quantum Information](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/) by Watrous\
Comprehensive introduction to quantum information theory, rather formal/mathematical, including some more specialized concepts
- [From Classical to Quantum Shannon Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1445) by Wilde\
Very comprehensive introduction to classical and quantum information theory, focus on coding and data compression, data transmission
- [Lecture notes](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html#lecture) of John Preskill (Chapters 1-4 and 10) and [corresponding videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0ojjrEqIyPy-1RRD8cTD_lF1hflo89Iu)
